# Before and After - Swipe to Reveal
A really simple desktop and mobile compatible swipe to reveal script. Free to use in whichever way you see fit.

Tested as working in Chrome 35, Firefox 30, Safari 7, iOS 7, Android 4.4 Chrome 35

## Layout
Yes it is a bit ugly, the design is up to you. I was just proving that offsetting the element won't effect the swipe.
